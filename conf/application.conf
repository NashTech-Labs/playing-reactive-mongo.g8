# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
# db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
# db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
# db.default.user=sa
# db.default.password=""

# Redis

# This module supports play 2.4 NamedCaches through key namespacing on a single Sedis pool. To add additional namepsaces besides the default (play), the configuration would look like such:
play.cache.redis.bindCaches = ["db-cache", "user-cache", "session-cache"]
# Specify a URI-based configuration using redis.uri
redis.uri="redis://localhost:6379"
